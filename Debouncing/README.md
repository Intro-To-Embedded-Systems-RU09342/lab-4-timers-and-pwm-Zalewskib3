# Software Debouncing
This lab required us to make sure that a long button click wouldnt be confused with 2 individual clicks. Software debouncing is basically extending the signal length of the button pressed in order to stop the possibility of multiple button presses in a row messing up the system and causing many other problems. This lab requires more code than the previous labs, due to the amount of more things we need to use inside the board. The code begins like every code, including the msp430.h file and stopping the watchdog timer. After this, most of the code is just setting up the output, by first clearing it and then setting the direction and such. Then it initializes the interrupts to make sure the button does what we want it to do. Then it initializes the timer and timer interrupts. Following the main function are two interrupt vector that initializes the timer interrupts and the button interrupts.
